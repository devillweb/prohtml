        <dt>2012–2013: Before Chase Atlantic</dt>
        <dd><q>Christian Anthony and Mitchel Cave were in a boy band called What About Tonight.</q> They formed the band
            to audition for season 4 of The X Factor Australia. However, they were eliminated in week two, coming in
            eleventh place.[3][4]

            Mitchel Cave's older brother, Clinton Cave, had a successful YouTube channel, ClintonCaveMusic, where the
            brothers would release cover songs regularly.[5] In 2012, the three released their first cover together[6]
            which would be of Bruno Mars' Locked Out of Heaven.[7] Later on, in 2013, they professionally performed
            together for the first time under the name K.I.D.S. (Kind Imaginations. Destructive Situations.) and
            released the original song "Addicted."[8] They have since deleted all content from the channel.</dd><br>

        <dt>2014–2015: Dalliance and Nostalgia</dt>
        <dd>The trio first released music under the name Chase Atlantic when Clinton Cave recruited Mitchel and
            Christian to assist in recording a university project.[10] The band would get their name, "Chase Atlantic"
            from nowhere. According to Mitchel, the name Chase Atlantic means nothing, it was a combination of two words
            that the band members liked, Chase and Atlantic, "We spend a couple of minutes trying to come up with a
            plausible and profound explanation for their band name. "It [Chase Atlantic] literally means nothing," says
            Cave. "It's so hard to find band names, we just put two words we really liked together that can't be
            associated with anything else."[11] Chase Atlantic officially released the EP Dalliance on 26 May 2014.[12]
            Their early sound was often described as Pop Rock and Pop Punk.[13]

            In February 2015, the band released their second EP, Nostalgia,[14] causing their song "Friends" to be
            associated with multiple Tumblr edits. "Friends" was also later certified Silver by the British Phonographic
            Industry (BPI) in 2022.[15]

            Later in 2015, the band caught the eye of Benji and Joel Madden, and they signed the group to their
            management company, MDDN, in early 2016.[16]</dd><br>
        <dt>2016–2018: EPs and debut studio album</dt>
        <dd>In January 2016, Chase Atlantic released "Obsessive". They followed up with their third EP, Paradise, in
            February 2016, which they promoted extensively.[17] [18]

            In January 2017, Chase Atlantic released their fourth EP, Part One, to coincide with their signing with
            Warner Bros. Records. This was followed by Part Two in March 2017. In mid-2017, the band announced their
            first tour of the United States, opening for Sleeping with Sirens' Gossip: Up Close & Personal Tour.[19][9]
            Chase Atlantic released Part Three in September 2017.[20]

            Their self-titled debut album, Chase Atlantic, was released in October 2017.[21] Later in 2017, they went on
            a headlining tour in the United States, where they played 16 shows across 11 states, followed by an
            Australian tour opening for Blackbear.[22][23]

            In 2018, the band continued touring the United States by opening for singer Lights and playing US and UK
            festivals, including Bonnaroo, Vans Warped Tour 2018, and Reading/Leeds Festival 2018.[24]

            They released standalone singles "Numb to the Feeling" and "Tidal Wave" in mid-2018.[25] Later that year,
            they also left Warner Brothers Records and went independent</dd><br>
        <dt>2019–2022: Phases and Beauty in Death</dt>
        <dd>The group spent January to April 2019 in Los Angeles, working on their second album.[27] In April, they
            announced the Phases Tour: North America for the summer of 2019, in support of their second album, Phases,
            and set the release date for 28 June 2019.[28] The album was preceded by three singles, "Her",
            "Stuckinmybrain", and "Love Is (Not) Easy", which were released on 10 May, 24 May, and 7 June 2019,
            respectively.

            In 2020, they began work on their third studio album, Beauty in Death, which the band released on 5 March
            2021.[29][30] Alongside their album rollout, they also released a collaborative single with dark pop artist
            Plvtinum, called "Hit My Line".[31] On 2 May 2022, the group announced the release of a deluxe edition of
            Beauty in Death</dd><br>
        <dt>2023–present: Return from Hiatus and Lost in Heaven</dt>
        <dd>In 2023, after a break to work on themselves,[33] Chase Atlantic made their return to the music scene with
            the release of the single "Mamacita" on 26 September. The track, which blends elements of alternative R&B
            and pop, marked the beginning of a new era for the band.[34]

            On 20 September 2024, they set the release of their next studio album, Lost in Heaven, for 1 November 2024.
            The album preceded three new singles "Die for Me", "Doubt It" and “Ricochet”, released on August 23, 20
            September and 11 October 2024, respectively, and would also include their previous release "Mamacita".[35]

            <mark><u> On 16 October 2024, Chase Atlantic embarked on their global tour, to promote their fourth album,
                    with performances scheduled at multiple venues worldwide, which include The Toyota Music Factory in
                    North America[36], the Riverstage Brisbane in Australia[37], The O2 Arena in United Kingdom, and the
                    Lanxess Arena in Europe</u></mark>
